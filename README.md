# Arch Linux Installation Scripts
Personal arch installation scripts, not made to be portable.

## Name scheme
Scripts' names follow this scheme :
> [de].sh

Where [de] stands for Desktop Environement.

Name schemes are used to tell what [de] is going to be installed
using a [de].sh script.

## Usage
These scripts are made to be launched while installing archlinux.
The prefered way is to launch them after being chrooted into your system.
